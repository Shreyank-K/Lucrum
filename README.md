A python based financial assistant web application built using the Streamlit library.



This application uses Streamlit as well as a few other tools

Installation:

```
pip install streamlit pandas plotly-express
```
The application also uses Sqlite3 for databasing, but it is generally included within Python's default library, so no separate installation is required.
